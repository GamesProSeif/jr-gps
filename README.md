A Repository for a Discord bot
This repository was created for hosting the actual bot.
This is a private Discord bot, meaning it would only work properly on the server the bot is on.
Feel free to copy and paste the code and learn from it.
I know it's nothing hard and I didn't do that great but anyways, you can just use it in your own way.
